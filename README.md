## üìÇ **Dataset and Preprocessing**
- A labeled dataset of landmark images was used to train and validate the models.
- Preprocessing steps included:
  - Resizing images to consistent dimensions.
  - Normalizing pixel values to optimize model convergence.
  - Data augmentation using `torchvision.transforms` to expand dataset diversity.

## üß† **Model Development**
1. **Custom CNN:**
   - Designed a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to classify images.
   - Served as the baseline model for initial experimentation.

2. **Transfer Learning with ResNet18:**
   - Utilized the pre-trained ResNet18 model from Torchvision.
   - Fine-tuned the final layers to adapt to the landmark classification task.
   - Achieved a significant boost in test accuracy compared to the custom CNN.
